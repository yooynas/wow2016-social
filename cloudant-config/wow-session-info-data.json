      "Abstract": "You know the impact and value weather data has on your business. But, there are so many weather data sources. And when you find the trusted source, how do get the data? more important, how do you use it? Getting trusted weather data can be easy (or difficult) depending on the type of weather data. Be ready for the storm. Come get hands-on expertise on accessing and using weather data alongside your own data. You will learn how to pull historical weather point data elements (temperature, wind speeds, gusts, humidity, etc.) and how to merge it with your own data for analytics. You will also learn about advanced techniques to get and manipulate weather radar / satellite data and visualize it through mapping platforms such as Mapbox.",
